## Introduction

**OmniCourse-core** is a TypeScript library providing the core model of the [OmniCourse](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse) project; as a consequence, it is especially useful whenever you need to access its data structures without having to depend on the UI components.

## Installation

First of all, please consider whether you actually need [the full OmniCourse library](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse): in that case, directly depending on **OmniCourse-core** is not required - as the data structures are exported by **OmniCourse** as well.

OmniCourse-core can be installed like any NPM package:

```bash
yarn add @giancosta86/omnicourse-core
```

The public API entirely resides in the root package index, so you shouldn't reference specific modules.

For details about installing and using _the whole OmniCourse project_, please refer to the [tutorial wiki page](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse/wiki/3.-Tutorial).

## Using the library

OmniCourse is described in detail in its [wiki](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse/wiki): for this library, please refer to the [core model](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse/wiki/2.-Core-model) section.
